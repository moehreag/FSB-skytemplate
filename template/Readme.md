__Readme for pack.mcmeta__

The most interesting Thing in this file is the
pack_format entry.


pack_format list for Minecraft versions:

1: 1.6.1–1.8.9 

2: 1.9–1.10.2 

3: 1.11–1.12.2 

4: 1.13–1.14.4 

5: 1.15–1.16.1 

6: 1.16.2–1.16.5 

7: 1.17-1.17.1

8: 1.18-1.18.2

(Most likely you will only ever use 6 and later because there is no FSB mod for earlier versions)
